            <p id="extra">Bryce Canyon was found by LDS pioneers, named after Ebenezer Bryce. It was found on February 25, 1928, making it nearly 100 years old. Technically, Bryce Canyon is not a canyon because there is no river running through it. While it looks amazing in the summer, Bryce Canyon may look even more stunning in the winter. All the different layers of rock have a thin layer of snow on top, which also breaks up all the red rock. The most famous hoodoo formation is Thor's Hammer, which is a large boulder precariously balanced on a much smaller bobulder.</p>
